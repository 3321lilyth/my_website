          <h1>I'm Lily!</h1>
          <p>
            A third-year student majoring in Computer Science at NYCU. I have a strong interest and passion for learning, and enjoy exploring new knowledge and fields. 
            In order to achieve happy learning and a happy life, I have been actively learning things that interest me besides focusing on the professional field of SC.
            I have been learning to sing from a professional vocal teacher and writing short essays and skits. These hobbies always bring smiles to my busy academic life.

          <p>
            My name is Lijia Yang (楊立嘉), and "Jia(嘉)" represents goodness, beauty, auspiciousness, and happiness. 
            My mother named me with the intention of being born in Chiayi, and hoping for a happy and prosperous life. 
            My father is a telecommunications engineer and my mother was once a Ph.D. in Chinese. 
            They strive to manage a warm and happy family, hoping that my brother and I can both achieve a simple and resilient character, 
            and they encourage us to explore and learn actively.
            My brother is a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at NTU, we share many common interests, such as watching anime and singing Japanese songs.

            I spent most of my time with my roommate, they are my best friends in NYCU.
            We traveled together, enjoyed delicious food together, attended classes together,
            discussed projects together, and accompanied each other through these difficult three years.

            Tracy is my best friend in EE department. Though the workload is
            heavy in EE, we still have spare time to do some crazy but silly
            things together, such as we had covered some songs on Youtube just
            for fun! You can check them on my <a href="film.html">film page</a>!
